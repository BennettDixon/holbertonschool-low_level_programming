# 0x02 Functions, & Nested Loops

Welcome to my  **low level C programming** experience at Holberton School. In this project we will be using nested loops as well as functions to complete different tasks. Read more about the goals below:


## Goals

-     
    What are nested loops and how to use them
    -   What is a function and how do you use functions
    -   What is the difference between a declaration and a definition of a function
    -   What is a prototype
    -   Scope of variables
