# :shell: 0x1A - C: Big O & Sorting Algorithms :shell:

In this project I will be learning more about Big O notation as well as sorting algorithms. Specifically, bubble, insertion, selection, and most importantly quick sort. I will be learning the various Big O notations for these algorithms as well as gain the ability to generate Big O notations for any function I come across.
