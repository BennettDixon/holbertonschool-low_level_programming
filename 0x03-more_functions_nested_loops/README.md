# 0x03. C - More functions, more nested loops

Welcome to my  **low level C programming** experience at Holberton School. In this project we will be using more nested loops as well as functions to complete different tasks. Read more about the goals below:


## Goals
-   What are nested loops and how to use them
-   What is a function and how do you use functions
-   What is the difference between a declaration and a definition of a function
-   What is a prototype
-   Scope of variables
-   What are the  `gcc`  flags  `-Wall -Werror -pedantic -Wextra`
-   What are header files and how to to use them with  `#include`
