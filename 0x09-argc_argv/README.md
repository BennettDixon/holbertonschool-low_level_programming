# 0x09- C - argC and argV

Welcome to my  **low level C programming** experience at Holberton School. In this project we will be using argC and argV to complete different tasks. Read more about the goals below:


## Goals
-   How to use arguments passed to your program
-   What are two prototypes of  `main`  that you know of, and in which case do you use one or the other
-   How to use  `__attribute__((unused))`  or  `(void)`  to compile functions with unused variables or parameters
