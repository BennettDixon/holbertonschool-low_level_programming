# Low Level Programming & Algorithms

Welcome to my  **low level C programming** experience at Holberton School. Here I will be documenting what I have learned through a series of projects. Holberton is a project based learning environment


## Goals

-  Learn about low level C code by building many functions from the ground up
- Will not use stdlib in the first few sets of problems
- Build our own shell, possibly in a seperate project
- Build our own printf statement, possibly in a seperate project

|----------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|
|0x00-hello-world|`Learn to use printf & puts`            |Used printf successfuly to convert char to int            |
|0x01-variables_if_else_while          |`Learn about control statements, loops, and variables`            |Learned how to use for loops with ascii values            |
|0x02-functions_and_nested_loops          |`Learn functions and nested loops`|Learned how functions and nested loops work on a basic level|
|0x03-more-functions_and_nested_loops     |`Learn more about functions and nested loops` | Coming Soon
