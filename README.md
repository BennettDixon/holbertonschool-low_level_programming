# Low Level Programming & Algorithms

Welcome to my  **low level C programming** experience at Holberton School. Here I will be documenting what I have learned through a series of projects. Holberton is a project based learning environment


## Goals

-  Learn about low level C code by building many functions from the ground up
- Will not use stdlib in the first few sets of problems
- Build our own shell, possibly in a seperate project
- Build our own printf statement, possibly in a seperate project


## Task Overview
|                |Goals                          |Outcome                         |
|----------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|
|0x00-Hello-World|`Learn to use printf & puts`            |Used printf successfuly to convert char to int            |
|0x01-Variables-If_Else_While          |`Learn about control statements, loops, and variables`            |Learned how to use for loops with ascii values            |
|0x02-Functions-and_Nested_Loops          |`Learn functions and nested loops`|Learned how functions and nested loops work on a basic level|
|0x03-More-functions-and_nested_loops     |`Learn more about functions and nested loops` | Learned more about nested loop use in algorithms | 
| 0x04-Pointers-Arrays-Strings | `Learn about pointers, arrays and strings` | Learned how to use pointers and arrays to initialize and modify strings
| 0x05-More-Pointers-Arrays-and-Strings | `Learn more about use of pointers and arrays` | Successfully implemented more complex string manipulation algorithms using pointer arithmetic
| 0x06-Even-More-Pointers-and-Strings | `Learn about complex pointer arithmetic` | Learned about assembly from crackme, lots of advanced pointer arithmetic, and rebuilding stdlib functions
| 0x07-Recursion | `Implement functions previously implemented with a linear approach recursively` | Successfully implemented lots of prior stdlib functions recursively as well as wild card string comparison. Learned lot's about the stack.
| 0x08-Static-Libraries | `Learn how to create, use, and index static libraries in our C programs` | Compiled multiple static libraries and used with various C files to reduce compilation time in the linking process.
| 0x09-Argc-Argv | `Learn how argc and argv are used to accept command line arguments with a C program` | Created various functions that took different amounts of input and performed different tasks. Advanced problem `100-change` is making minimum change from given cents.
| 0x0A-Malloc | `Learn how to use malloc to dynamically allocate memory in our programs` | Coming Soon
