# :shell: 0x1D - Search Algorithms :shell:

In this project I will be going over search algorithms and implementing them in C. Primarily Linear search and Binary search. I will also be adding files describing their Big-O space complexity and time complexity.

## :running: Getting Started

* [Ubuntu 14.04 LTS](http://releases.ubuntu.com/14.04/) - Operating system reqd.

* [GCC 4.8.4](https://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-4.8/) - Compiler used


## :warning: Prerequisites

* Must have `git` installed

* Must have repository cloned

* Must have `gcc` installed

```
$ sudo apt-get install git
```

Compile with:
```
$ gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra X-main.c X-problem.c -o X-output
```
Where X is the problem number for files that are relevant.
